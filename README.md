# Project Title: **Car Price Prediction**

## 1. Introduction

The automotive industry has seen a growing demand for accurate car price estimation due to various factors like increasing market competitiveness and customer preferences. Predicting car prices helps both buyers and sellers by providing insights into market trends, car depreciation, and optimal pricing strategies. Using AI/ML models for price prediction allows more precise estimations based on various car features.

## 2. Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build an AI/ML model that accurately predicts the price of a car based on its features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, engine capacity, fuel type, and mileage. Predicting car prices is a complex task because of the numerous factors influencing the market value of vehicles. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide a more data-driven approach to car pricing.

## 3. Dataset and Feature Engineering

Several studies highlight the importance of feature selection and engineering when working with car price prediction. Features commonly used include:

- **Age of the car**: Older cars generally have a lower price.
- **Mileage**: More mileage typically lowers the car's value.
- **Fuel Type**: Diesel cars might depreciate slower compared to petrol or electric vehicles, though market trends change.
- **Make and Model**: Premium brands or limited-edition models often command higher prices.

Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that enhance the prediction performance. Techniques like one-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., brand, fuel type), scaling for numerical values (e.g., mileage), and handling inputs for missing data are crucial.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Collection

Data will be sourced from publicly available car sales datasets, which typically include vehicle specifications (e.g., make, model, year, engine type, etc.) along with sale prices. Alternatively, scraping websites like Autotrader or Kaggle may provide valuable datasets for training purposes.

### 4.2 Model Building

For this project, we will experiment with several machine learning algorithms, including:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Gradient Boosting**

### 4.3 Evaluation

Once the models are trained, their performance will be evaluated on a test set. The model with the lowest error rate and highest predictive accuracy will be selected as the final model.

## 5. Conclusion

By the end of this project, we aim to develop an AI/ML-based model that predicts car prices based on a vehicle’s features. Our model will offer transparency in terms of the features used and the predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we hope to explore the limitations of different machine learning models for car price prediction and investigate ways to improve the model’s performance over time.
